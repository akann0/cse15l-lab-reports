# Lab Report 5, week 10

I found the tests that showed different results 
using java.  I copy and pasted my getLinks method onto
the given MarkdownParse method.  I then asked the code to 
compare the outputs of these two methods, and print the filename
if they were not equal.  Using this method I found the 22 tests 
with different outputs.
