> O say, can you see

> By the dawn's early light

> What so proudly we hail'd

> At the twilight's last gleaming?

> Whose broad stripes and bright stars

> Through the perilous fight

> O'er the ramparts we watch'd

> Were so gallantly streaming?

> And the rocket's red glare

> The bombs bursting in air

> Gave proof through the night

> That our flag was still there

> O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave

> O'er the land of the *free*

> And the home of the brave?
